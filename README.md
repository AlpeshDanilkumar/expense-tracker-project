## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Required for containerization. Install from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. **Docker Compose**: Needed to manage multi-container Docker applications. Install from [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Create Dockerfile

Define the environment for the Flask application:

```dockerfile

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
2. Create Docker Compose File
Define services in docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.7'
services:
  expense-tracker:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:

    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:13

      POSTGRES_USER: expense_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: expense_tracker
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"

      - grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  grafana_data:
3. Create Prometheus Configuration
Configure Prometheus with prometheus.yml:

yaml
Copy code
# prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flask'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['expense-tracker:5000']
4. Create Requirements File
List the Python dependencies in requirements.txt:

txt
Copy code
Flask
SQLAlchemy
psycopg2-binary
prometheus-flask-exporter
5. Create Flask Application
Implement the Flask application in app.py:

python
Copy code
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from prometheus_flask_exporter import PrometheusMetrics

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://expense_user:password@db/expense_tracker'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)

class Expense(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    description = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    amount = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)

@app.route('/expenses', methods=['POST'])
def add_expense():
    data = request.json
    new_expense = Expense(description=data['description'], amount=data['amount'])
    db.session.add(new_expense)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Expense added"}), 201

@app.route('/expenses', methods=['GET'])
def get_expenses():
    expenses = Expense.query.all()
    return jsonify([{'id': e.id, 'description': e.description, 'amount': e.amount} for e in expenses])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
Running the Application
1. Build and Start Containers
Run the following command to build and start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
2. Access the Application
Flask App: http://localhost:5000
Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (Login with default username admin and password admin)
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Monitoring and SRE
Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus collects metrics from your Flask application. Ensure your application exposes metrics at the /metrics endpoint using prometheus-flask-exporter.
Grafana visualizes these metrics. Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana:
Go to Configuration > Data Sources > Add data source.
Select Prometheus.
Set the URL to http://prometheus:9090.
Click Save & Test.
Creating Dashboards in Grafana
Create a Dashboard:
Navigate to Dashboards > New Dashboard.
Add panels to visualize metrics like request counts, response times, etc.
Configure panels to use data from Prometheus.
GitHub Actions Pipeline
Setup GitHub Actions
Create a Workflow File

Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml in your repository:

yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy to EC2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Cache Docker layers
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.cache/docker
            /tmp/.buildx-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-docker-${{ github.sha }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-docker-

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: your-dockerhub-username/your-repo:latest

      - name: Deploy to EC2
        env:
          HOST: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          USERNAME: ${{ secrets.EC2_USERNAME }}
          PEM_FILE: ${{ secrets.EC2_PEM_FILE }}
        run: |
          echo "$PEM_FILE" > ec2-key.pem
          chmod 600 ec2-key.pem
          ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ec2-key.pem $USERNAME@$HOST "cd /home/ubuntu/expense-tracker && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up --build -d"
Set Up Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository settings:

EC2_HOST: The public IP or DNS of your EC2 instance.
EC2_USERNAME: The username for SSH (typically ubuntu for EC2 instances).
EC2_PEM_FILE: The content of your .pem file for SSH access.
Future Improvements
Add More Metrics: Implement additional metrics in your Flask application for enhanced monitoring.
Improve Security: Secure Prometheus and Grafana instances and configure authentication for your Flask application.
Automate Deployments: Enhance the GitHub Actions pipeline for more sophisticated deployment workflows.
Enhanced Monitoring: Integrate with other monitoring tools or services for comprehensive application health tracking.
